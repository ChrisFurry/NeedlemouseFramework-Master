 That dumb framework ChrisFurry made

# About
This is the framework ChrisFurry made to be mostly accurate to the Genesis Sonic games. 
It has mostly everything you'd need for a Sonic Fangame. 
The code was made to be somewhat simple for people to read, along with comments, but also somewhat complex.
