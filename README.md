# FAIR WARNING
I don't use Gamemaker Studio 2, ever since I lost the account I had with my perma license.
I don't plan on updating this framework anymore.
It probably isn't the most well build.

# About
This is the framework ChrisFurry made to be mostly accurate to the Genesis Sonic games. 
It has mostly everything you'd need for a Sonic Fangame. 
The code was made to be somewhat simple for people to read, along with comments, but also somewhat complex.

# Want to help?
If you dm me and want to make this framework actually good I wouldn't mind giving you contributor access
But it might be better to just make a fork, or make your own framework.
